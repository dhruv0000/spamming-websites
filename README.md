##Spamming/Testing websites using webdriver

WebDriver works with almost any programming language(For sake of simplicity, I used python), and most of the browsers suppoutwebDrivers for automation of task.
NOTE:You need to install the webDriver for chrome as it is not included in the Selenium package, included in the repo.(It does include webDriver for firefox though.)

To make the code run every 30 min, I used a simple command 'watch'(Designed to repetative run ls command, to 'watch' the changes in a folder).

1. Insatll selenium for python
2. Change the path location on line 5
3. Open terminal and execute :watch -n 1800 python new.py
(Program will run till terminal is open)
